Overview:

My Wealth of Nations Data Explorer! 🌍💰 In this project, I dived into the Wealth of Nations data, using Excel and Tableau to clean, filter, visualize, and analyze my data.

Project Structure:

Data: Wealth of Nations
Scripts: Excel 
Visualizations: Tableau visualizations
Documentations: Microsoft Powerpoint

Excel Magic: ✨📈

In the Excel phase of the project, I employed a variety of techniques to wrangle and analyze the data:

Filtering: I utilized Excel's robust filtering capabilities to focus on specific subsets of data, allowing for a more detailed analysis of particular economic aspects.

Data Type Transformation: Ensuring accurate data representation is key. I adjusted data types to guarantee precision in calculations and visualizations.

Chart Creation: Charts are worth a thousand words. I created visually appealing charts to highlight trends, patterns, and disparities in economic data.

Macro Magic: To streamline repetitive tasks and enhance efficiency, I implemented macros to automate processes, making the analysis smoother and more accessible.

Tableau Tales: 📊📰

After Excel I used Tableau to elevate the analysis to the next level:

Dashboard Design: The ultimate goal is to make complex data easily understandable. I crafted interactive dashboards in Tableau, providing an immersive experience for users to explore the economic landscape of different countries.

Top 20 Wealthiest/Poorest Countries: One of the highlights of this project is the creation of a dashboard showcasing the top 20 wealthiest and poorest countries. The visualizations I used encapsulates the different countries.
